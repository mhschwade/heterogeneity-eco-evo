# heterogeneity-eco-evo
R scripts, functions and configurations used for simulations and data analysis in my master thesis Effects of Environmental Heterogeneity over Macroevolutionary Processes.

In this repository are the main code files used to built the master thesis, including:

- Simulation configs;
- Scripts to create landscapes;
- Auxiliar functions;
- A subtly modified version of gen3sis package (gen3sis2);
- Scripts for data analysis.

This repository is in building. If you have some doubt or if you have interest in this work, please, contact me by e-mail: marceloh.schwade@gmail.com.

## Master thesis

All this repository is for implementation, execution and data analisys of eco-evolutionary simulations that were part of my master thesis in Ecology.
The master thesis was defended at PPG Ecologia of UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul) on April 30, 2025.
The thesis pdf is the file `DissertacaoMarceloSchwade.pdf`.

## About gen3sis2

gen3sis2 is a little modified version of gen3sis package. This version was installed manually and then used to run all the simulations of this work.
For now, the discussion about all the modifications carried out in the adapted version of gen3sis can be finding in the pdf of the master thesis.

The version of gen3sis package used to run simulations was compressed and saved into the directory `gen3sis2` in file `gen3sis_1.5.11.tar.gz`.

In future I must add a submodule with a repository of this adapted version of package. If you want more information about this modified version, please, contact me.
