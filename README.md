# heterogeneity-eco-evo-gen3sis
R scripts, functions and configurations used for simulations and data analysis in my master thesis Effects of Environmental Heterogeneity over Macroevolutionary Processes.

In this repository are the main code files used to built the master thesis, including:

- Simulation configs;
- Scripts to create landscapes;
- Auxiliar functions;
- A subtly modified version of gen3sis package;
- Scripts for data analysis.

This repository is in building. If you have some doubt or if you have interest in this work, please, contact me by e-mail: marceloh.schwade@gmail.com.
